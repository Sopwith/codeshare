### How to Download a file
You can easily download or work with files by creating your own clone or fork of parts of the CIRPA repository. But if you just want to download a single file:
1. Click on the file/script you want.
2. Right-click the "Raw" button on the top of the file's text box interface.

3. Click "Save link as..." (or equivalent in your browser) to save the file/script and use it.
