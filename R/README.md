[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Although R has a command line interface, there are several graphical user interfaces, such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an integrated development environment.

## What's here
* **Code** - Until we have a need to start sorting code into categories, it can all go into this folder! Upload anything you are using or find useful. 

**Please ensure all submissions are adequately commented, both with an introduction section at the top, and in-line whenever useful. Also please ensure your code identifies any required packages or dependencies.**

## How to Download a file
You can easily download or work with files by creating your own clone or fork of parts of the CIRPA repository. But if you just want to download a single file:
1. Click on the file/script you want.
2. Right-click the "Raw" button on the top of the file's text box interface.

3. Click "Save link as..." (or equivalent in your browser) to save the file/script and use it.

## Getting started in R
There are many ways to go about starting and learning R. Google will let you dive into many of these. 

Our preferred way to jump in for beginners is to simply [download and install R](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/) itself, then [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (or a similar integrated development environment (IDE)). Launch RStudio, and you're ready to start playing with the code!
