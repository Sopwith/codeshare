Visualization Gallery
=======

This area is meant to be a place of inspiration. Take a look around and see what sort of ways you can visualize data. Wherever possible, there will be code or instructions on how to make these things yourself. 

Have you made some pretty cool graphs and charts, and want to share them with your CIRPA colleagues? [Send them to us](mailto:sechilds@yorku; fhay@conestogac.on.ca), with your code and instructions for how you made them, and we'll try to feature them here.
