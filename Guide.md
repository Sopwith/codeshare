## A Simple Guide to This Repository
---
You're currently reading a file within a repository, sorted into folders. We're using **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, which is a platform for storing and developing code in a collaborative way.

It's collaborative in a few ways.
1. **You can use any code that you can access on GitHub**, because in addition to downloading individual files, you can make your own copy of things and use them as you see fit. This is called a "Fork". 
2. **You can send messages to the authour(s) of the code, and ask them questions.** Each file contains version history and explains how it has changed over time, and who made those changes.
3. **You can edit a copy of the code and submit your version to the authuor(s)** as an updated version, for them to consider merging into the original (Master) copy. This is called "Pull request" - where you request that your "fork" (copy of the original) be "pulled" (integrated) into the main repository.
