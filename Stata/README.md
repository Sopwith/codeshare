IBM's SPSS Statistics (originally Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a software package used for statistical analysis. It features a default suite of statistical capabilities, and features many optional proprietary add-ons for a myriad of niches across business, science, social science, health, and beyond. Something of a juggernaut, it is one of the most powerful, biggest-business and longest-running statistical packages on the market, as well as one of the most expensive. It's a common application for statistical analysis in many older IR offices.
