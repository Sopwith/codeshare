## File Descriptions
* Auto-Report Example

	This file demonstrates how to use Visual Basic (VBA) in Excel to loop a reporting template through a list of program keys. Each loop changes up a report sheet (or sheets) to show data for a different program. Then Excel is instructed to export that sheet (or sheets), either to a PDF or as a static Excel file. The result is that you can assemble your data into a reporting "machine", hit a button, and all my reports spit out sequentially in the span of a few seconds or minutes.
